        <h1>The genetics of eye color: why brown appears dominant</h1>
        <p>
          Melanin is the pigment that determines brown eyes, while the lack of it causes blue eyes
          through a scattering effect. Think of melanin as the iris' built-in light dimmer—the more
          pigment you have, the richer and darker the color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue and green eyes do not contain blue pigments. Instead, they rely on Rayleigh
          scattering, the same phenomenon that makes the sky look blue. Light enters the iris,
          bounces through structural layers, and reflects back out in cooler tones based on the
          remaining trace pigments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to sixteen genes take part in this chromatic symphony, but OCA2 and HERC2 steal the
          spotlight. HERC2 is the switch that determines whether OCA2 gets to produce melanin. A
          tiny mutation—essentially an off switch—reduces pigment production and reveals blue hues.

          When translating complex science into marketing stories, I lean on this narrative arc:
          explain the phenomenon, humanize the mechanism, and end with a memorable metaphor. Facts
          stay intact, but curiosity leads the way.
