            <h1>The Genetics of Eye Color: Why Brown is Dominant</h1>
            
            <p>
                The Role of Melanin. Eye color is primarily determined by the amount of **melanin** (a dark brown pigment) present in the iris. People with brown eyes have large amounts of melanin concentrated in the front layer of the iris. Because melanin absorbs light, less light is reflected back, leading to the brown color. Brown is considered dominant because the genes responsible for melanin production are typically "on."

              The Magic of Light Scattering. Blue and green eyes don't have blue or green pigments. Instead, they have very little melanin in the front of the iris. When light enters, it hits the structural layers and is scattered back out—a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. This is the same effect that makes the sky appear blue. Depending on the exact structure and trace amounts of yellow/brown pigments present, the resulting color appears blue, grey, or green.

              Key Genes in the Mix. While it was once taught that a single gene controls eye color, scientists now know that up to 16 genes are involved. The two most important genes are **OCA2** and **HERC2**, both located on chromosome 15. The HERC2 gene acts like a switch, controlling whether the OCA2 gene (which produces melanin) is activated. A tiny mutation in HERC2 can essentially "turn off" melanin production in the iris, leading to blue eyes.
